The\n\t    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t    registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t  \n\t    Terminology\n\t    -----------\n\t  \n\t    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t  \n\t    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t  \n\t    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t  \n\t    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t    itself fulfill.\n\t  \n\t  \n\t    Basic Usage:\n\t    ------------\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t      // on success\n\t      resolve(value);\n\t  \n\t      // on failure\n\t      reject(reason);\n\t    });\n\t  \n\t    promise.then(function(value) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Advanced Usage:\n\t    ---------------\n\t  \n\t    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    function getJSON(url) {\n\t      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t  \n\t        xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t        xhr.send();\n\t  \n\t        function handler() {\n\t          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t            if (this.status === 200) {\n\t              resolve(this.response);\n\t            } else {\n\t              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t            }\n\t          }\n\t        };\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    Promise.all([\n\t      getJSON('/posts'),\n\t      getJSON('/comments')\n\t    ]).then(function(values){\n\t      values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t  \n\t      return values;\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @class Promise\n\t    @param {Function} resolver\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @constructor\n\t  */\n\t\n\t  var Promise$1 = function () {\n\t    function Promise(resolver) {\n\t      this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t      this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t      this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t      if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t        this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t     ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function(user){\n\t      // user is available\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     Chaining\n\t    --------\n\t     The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t     ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return user.name;\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      return 'default name';\n\t    }).then(function (userName) {\n\t      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t      // will be `'default name'`\n\t    });\n\t     findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t     ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     Assimilation\n\t    ------------\n\t     Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\t     ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // The user's comments are now available\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t     ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     Simple Example\n\t    --------------\n\t     Synchronous Example\n\t     ```javascript\n\t    let result;\n\t     try {\n\t      result = findResult();\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t     Errback Example\n\t     ```js\n\t    findResult(function(result, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     Promise Example;\n\t     ```javascript\n\t    findResult().then(function(result){\n\t      // success\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // failure\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     Advanced Example\n\t    --------------\n\t     Synchronous Example\n\t     ```javascript\n\t    let author, books;\n\t     try {\n\t      author = findAuthor();\n\t      books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t     Errback Example\n\t     ```js\n\t     function foundBooks(books) {\n\t     }\n\t     function failure(reason) {\n\t     }\n\t     findAuthor(function(author, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        failure(err);\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        try {\n\t          findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n\t            if (err) {\n\t              failure(err);\n\t            } else {\n\t              try {\n\t                foundBooks(books);\n\t              } catch(reason) {\n\t                failure(reason);\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          });\n\t        } catch(error) {\n\t          failure(err);\n\t        }\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     Promise Example;\n\t     ```javascript\n\t    findAuthor().\n\t      then(findBooksByAuthor).\n\t      then(function(books){\n\t        // found books\n\t    }).catch(function(reason){\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t     @method then\n\t    @param {Function} onFulfilled\n\t    @param {Function} onRejected\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t    */\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t    `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n\t    as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\t    ```js\n\t    function findAuthor(){\n\t    throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n\t    }\n\t    // synchronous\n\t    try {\n\t    findAuthor();\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t    // something went wrong\n\t    }\n\t    // async with promises\n\t    findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n\t    // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t    @method catch\n\t    @param {Function} onRejection\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t    */\n\t\n\t    Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\n\t      return this.then(null, onRejection);\n\t    };\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t      `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n\t      try/catch/finally behaves\n\t    \n\t      Synchronous example:\n\t    \n\t      ```js\n\t      findAuthor() {\n\t        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n\t          throw new Error();\n\t        }\n\t        return new Author();\n\t      }\n\t    \n\t      try {\n\t        return findAuthor();

The\n\t    primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t    registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n\t    why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t  \n\t    Terminology\n\t    -----------\n\t  \n\t    - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t    - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t    - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t    - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t    - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t    - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t  \n\t    A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t  \n\t    Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t    state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t    rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t  \n\t    Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t    promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t    settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t    itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t    itself fulfill.\n\t  \n\t  \n\t    Basic Usage:\n\t    ------------\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t      // on success\n\t      resolve(value);\n\t  \n\t      // on failure\n\t      reject(reason);\n\t    });\n\t  \n\t    promise.then(function(value) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Advanced Usage:\n\t    ---------------\n\t  \n\t    Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t    `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    function getJSON(url) {\n\t      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t        let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t  \n\t        xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t        xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t        xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t        xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t        xhr.send();\n\t  \n\t        function handler() {\n\t          if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t            if (this.status === 200) {\n\t              resolve(this.response);\n\t            } else {\n\t              reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t            }\n\t          }\n\t        };\n\t      });\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t      // on fulfillment\n\t    }, function(reason) {\n\t      // on rejection\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    Promise.all([\n\t      getJSON('/posts'),\n\t      getJSON('/comments')\n\t    ]).then(function(values){\n\t      values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t      values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t  \n\t      return values;\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @class RSVP.Promise\n\t    @param {function} resolver\n\t    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @constructor\n\t  */\n\t\n\t  var Promise = function () {\n\t    function Promise(resolver, label) {\n\t      this._id = counter++;\n\t      this._label = label;\n\t      this._state = undefined;\n\t      this._result = undefined;\n\t      this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t      config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\t\n\t      if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t        typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t        this instanceof Promise ?

This is called *assimilation*.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // The user's comments are now available\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Simple Example\n\t    --------------\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous Example\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let result;\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      result = findResult();\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Errback Example\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findResult(function(result, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Promise Example;\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    findResult().then(function(result){\n\t      // success\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // failure\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Advanced Example\n\t    --------------\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous Example\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let author, books;\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      author = findAuthor();\n\t      books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Errback Example\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t  \n\t    function foundBooks(books) {\n\t  \n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    function failure(reason) {\n\t  \n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    findAuthor(function(author, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        failure(err);\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        try {\n\t          findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n\t            if (err) {\n\t              failure(err);\n\t            } else {\n\t              try {\n\t                foundBooks(books);\n\t              } catch(reason) {\n\t                failure(reason);\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          });\n\t        } catch(error) {\n\t          failure(err);\n\t        }\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Promise Example;\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    findAuthor().\n\t      then(findBooksByAuthor).\n\t      then(function(books){\n\t        // found books\n\t    }).catch(function(reason){\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @method then\n\t    @param {Function} onFulfillment\n\t    @param {Function} onRejection\n\t    @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t  Promise.prototype.then = then;\n\t\n\t  function Result() {\n\t    this.value = undefined;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var ERROR = new Result();\n\t  var GET_THEN_ERROR$1 = new Result();\n\t\n\t  function getThen$1(obj) {\n\t    try {\n\t      return obj.then;\n\t    } catch (error) {\n\t      ERROR.value = error;\n\t      return ERROR;\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function tryApply(f, s, a) {\n\t    try {\n\t      f.apply(s, a);\n\t    } catch (error) {\n\t      ERROR.value = error;\n\t      return ERROR;\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function makeObject(_, argumentNames) {\n\t    var obj = {};\n\t    var length = _.length;\n\t    var args = new Array(length);\n\t\n\t    for (var x = 0; x < length; x++) {\n\t      args[x] = _[x];\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    for (var i = 0; i < argumentNames.length; i++) {\n\t      var name = argumentNames[i];\n\t      obj[name] = args[i + 1];\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    return obj;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function arrayResult(_) {\n\t    var length = _.length;\n\t    var args = new Array(length - 1);\n\t\n\t    for (var i = 1; i < length; i++) {\n\t      args[i - 1] = _[i];\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    return args;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function wrapThenable(_then, promise) {\n\t    return {\n\t      then: function then(onFulFillment, onRejection) {\n\t        return _then.call(promise, onFulFillment, onRejection);\n\t      }\n\t    };\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    `RSVP.denodeify` takes a 'node-style' function and returns a function that\n\t    will return an `RSVP.Promise`. You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n\t    browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n\t    `denodeify` transforms the following:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let fs = require('fs');\n\t  \n\t    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n\t      if (err) return handleError(err);\n\t      handleData(data);\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    into:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let fs = require('fs');\n\t    let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\t  \n\t    readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n\t    just returns the first one:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'));\n\t  \n\t    request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n\t      // ...\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n\t    second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n\t    as an array:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), true);\n\t  \n\t    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n\t      // result[0] -> res\n\t      // result[1] -> body\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n\t  \n\t    request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n\t      // result.res\n\t      // result.body\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let app = require('express')();\n\t    let render = RSVP.denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n\t    environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n\t    function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n\t    denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request')),\n\t        cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n\t  \n\t    request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n\t      // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n\t    of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let fs = require('fs');\n\t  \n\t    fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n\t      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n\t      fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n\t        if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n\t      });\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let fs = require('fs');\n\t    let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\t    let writeFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n\t  \n\t    readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n\t      return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n\t    }).then(function(){\n\t    }).catch(function(error){\n\t      // Handle error\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @method denodeify\n\t    @static\n\t    @for RSVP\n\t    @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n\t    its last argument. The callback expects an error to be passed as its first\n\t    argument (if an error occurred, otherwise null), and the value from the\n\t    operation as its second argument ('function(err, value){ }').\n\t    @param {Boolean|Array} [options] An optional paramter that if set\n\t    to `true` causes the promise to fulfill with the callback's success arguments\n\t    as an array. This is useful if the node function has multiple success\n\t    paramters. If you set this paramter to an array with names, the promise will\n\t    fulfill with a hash with these names as keys and the success parameters as\n\t    values.\n\t    @return {Function} a function that wraps `nodeFunc` to return an\n\t    `RSVP.Promise`\n\t    @static\n\t  */\n\t  function denodeify(nodeFunc, options) {\n\t    var fn = function fn() {\n\t      var self = this;\n\t      var l = arguments.length;\n\t      var args = new Array(l + 1);\n\t      var promiseInput = false;\n\t\n\t      for (var i = 0; i < l; ++i) {\n\t        var arg = arguments[i];\n\t\n\t        if (!promiseInput) {\n\t          // TODO: clean this up\n\t          promiseInput = needsPromiseInput(arg);\n\t          if (promiseInput === GET_THEN_ERROR$1) {\n\t            var p = new Promise(noop);\n\t            reject(p, GET_THEN_ERROR$1.value);\n\t            return p;\n\t          } else if (promiseInput && promiseInput !== true) {\n\t            arg = wrapThenable(promiseInput, arg);\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t        args[i] = arg;\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      var promise = new Promise(noop);\n\t\n\t      args[l] = function (err, val) {\n\t        if (err) reject(promise, err);else if (options === undefined) resolve(promise, val);else if (options === true) resolve(promise, arrayResult(arguments));else if (isArray(options)) resolve(promise, makeObject(arguments, options));else resolve(promise, val);\n\t      };\n\t\n\t      if (promiseInput) {\n\t        return handlePromiseInput(promise, args, nodeFunc, self);\n\t      } else {\n\t        return handleValueInput(promise, args, nodeFunc, self);\n\t      }\n\t    };\n\t\n\t    fn.__proto__ = nodeFunc;\n\t\n\t    return fn;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function handleValueInput(promise, args, nodeFunc, self) {\n\t    var result = tryApply(nodeFunc, self, args);\n\t    if (result === ERROR) {\n\t      reject(promise, result.value);\n\t    }\n\t    return promise;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function handlePromiseInput(promise, args, nodeFunc, self) {\n\t    return Promise.all(args).then(function (args) {\n\t      var result = tryApply(nodeFunc, self, args);\n\t      if (result === ERROR) {\n\t        reject(promise, result.value);\n\t      }\n\t      return promise;\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function needsPromiseInput(arg) {\n\t    if (arg && (typeof arg === 'undefined' ?

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n   @method then\n  @param {Function} onFulfilled\n  @param {Function} onRejected\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n  /**\n  `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n  as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n  ```js\n  function findAuthor(){\n  throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n  }\n  // synchronous\n  try {\n  findAuthor();\n  } catch(reason) {\n  // something went wrong\n  }\n  // async with promises\n  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n  // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n  @method catch\n  @param {Function} onRejection\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n\n  Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n  };\n\n  /**\n    `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n    try/catch/finally behaves\n  \n    Synchronous example:\n  \n    ```js\n    findAuthor() {\n      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n        throw new Error();\n      }\n      return new Author();\n    }\n  \n    try {\n      return findAuthor();

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class RSVP.Promise\n  @param {function} resolver\n  @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver, label) {\n    this._id = counter++;\n    this._label = label;\n    this._state = undefined;\n    this._result = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ?

This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n  ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n\n  If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n  ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Simple Example\n  --------------\n\n  Synchronous Example\n\n  ```javascript\n  let result;\n\n  try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Errback Example\n\n  ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Promise Example;\n\n  ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Example\n  --------------\n\n  Synchronous Example\n\n  ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n\n  try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Errback Example\n\n  ```js\n\n  function foundBooks(books) {\n\n  }\n\n  function failure(reason) {\n\n  }\n\n  findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Promise Example;\n\n  ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method then\n  @param {Function} onFulfillment\n  @param {Function} onRejection\n  @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n*/\nPromise.prototype.then = then;\n\nfunction Result() {\n  this.value = undefined;\n}\n\nvar ERROR = new Result();\nvar GET_THEN_ERROR$1 = new Result();\n\nfunction getThen$1(obj) {\n  try {\n    return obj.then;\n  } catch (error) {\n    ERROR.value = error;\n    return ERROR;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction tryApply(f, s, a) {\n  try {\n    f.apply(s, a);\n  } catch (error) {\n    ERROR.value = error;\n    return ERROR;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction makeObject(_, argumentNames) {\n  var obj = {};\n  var length = _.length;\n  var args = new Array(length);\n\n  for (var x = 0; x < length; x++) {\n    args[x] = _[x];\n  }\n\n  for (var i = 0; i < argumentNames.length; i++) {\n    var name = argumentNames[i];\n    obj[name] = args[i + 1];\n  }\n\n  return obj;\n}\n\nfunction arrayResult(_) {\n  var length = _.length;\n  var args = new Array(length - 1);\n\n  for (var i = 1; i < length; i++) {\n    args[i - 1] = _[i];\n  }\n\n  return args;\n}\n\nfunction wrapThenable(then, promise) {\n  return {\n    then: function (onFulFillment, onRejection) {\n      return then.call(promise, onFulFillment, onRejection);\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n/**\n  `RSVP.denodeify` takes a 'node-style' function and returns a function that\n  will return an `RSVP.Promise`. You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n  browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n  `denodeify` transforms the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let fs = require('fs');\n\n  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n    if (err) return handleError(err);\n    handleData(data);\n  });\n  ```\n\n  into:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let fs = require('fs');\n  let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\n  readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n  ```\n\n  If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n  just returns the first one:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'));\n\n  request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n    // ...\n  });\n  ```\n\n  However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n  second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n  as an array:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), true);\n\n  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n    // result[0] -> res\n    // result[1] -> body\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n\n  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n    // result.res\n    // result.body\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let app = require('express')();\n  let render = RSVP.denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n  ```\n\n  The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n  environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n  function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n  denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let request = RSVP.denodeify(require('request')),\n      cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n\n  request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n    // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n  of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let fs = require('fs');\n\n  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n    if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n    fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n    });\n  });\n  ```\n\n  you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let fs = require('fs');\n  let readFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.readFile);\n  let writeFile = RSVP.denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n\n  readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n    return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n  }).then(function(){\n  }).catch(function(error){\n    // Handle error\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method denodeify\n  @static\n  @for RSVP\n  @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n  its last argument.

New code should use the `RSVP.Promise` constructor instead.\n\n  The object returned from `RSVP.defer` is a plain object with three properties:\n\n  * promise - an `RSVP.Promise`.\n  * reject - a function that causes the `promise` property on this object to\n    become rejected\n  * resolve - a function that causes the `promise` property on this object to\n    become fulfilled.\n\n  Example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   let deferred = RSVP.defer();\n\n   deferred.resolve(\"Success!\");\n\n   deferred.promise.then(function(value){\n     // value here is \"Success!\"\n   });\n   ```\n\n  @method defer\n  @static\n  @for RSVP\n  @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Object}\n */\n\nfunction defer(label) {\n  var deferred = { resolve: undefined, reject: undefined };\n\n  deferred.promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n    deferred.resolve = resolve;\n    deferred.reject = reject;\n  }, label);\n\n  return deferred;\n}\n\n/**\n `RSVP.map` is similar to JavaScript's native `map` method, except that it\n  waits for all promises to become fulfilled before running the `mapFn` on\n  each item in given to `promises`. `RSVP.map` returns a promise that will\n  become fulfilled with the result of running `mapFn` on the values the promises\n  become fulfilled with.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n\n  let promise1 = RSVP.resolve(1);\n  let promise2 = RSVP.resolve(2);\n  let promise3 = RSVP.resolve(3);\n  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];\n\n  let mapFn = function(item){\n    return item + 1;\n  };\n\n  RSVP.map(promises, mapFn).then(function(result){\n    // result is [ 2, 3, 4 ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  If any of the `promises` given to `RSVP.map` are rejected, the first promise\n  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promise's\n  rejection handler. For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = RSVP.resolve(1);\n  let promise2 = RSVP.reject(new Error('2'));\n  let promise3 = RSVP.reject(new Error('3'));\n  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];\n\n  let mapFn = function(item){\n    return item + 1;\n  };\n\n  RSVP.map(promises, mapFn).then(function(array){\n    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // reason.message === '2'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  `RSVP.map` will also wait if a promise is returned from `mapFn`. For example,\n  say you want to get all comments from a set of blog posts, but you need\n  the blog posts first because they contain a url to those comments.\n\n  ```javscript\n\n  let mapFn = function(blogPost){\n    // getComments does some ajax and returns an RSVP.Promise that is fulfilled\n    // with some comments data\n    return getComments(blogPost.comments_url);\n  };\n\n  // getBlogPosts does some ajax and returns an RSVP.Promise that is fulfilled\n  // with some blog post data\n  RSVP.map(getBlogPosts(), mapFn).then(function(comments){\n    // comments is the result of asking the server for the comments\n    // of all blog posts returned from getBlogPosts()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method map\n  @static\n  @for RSVP\n  @param {Array} promises\n  @param {Function} mapFn function to be called on each fulfilled promise.\n  @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} promise that is fulfilled with the result of calling\n  `mapFn` on each fulfilled promise or value when they become fulfilled.\n   The promise will be rejected if any of the given `promises` become rejected.\n  @static\n*/\nfunction map(promises, mapFn, label) {\n  if (!isArray(promises)) {\n    return Promise.reject(new TypeError(\"RSVP.map must be called with an array\"), label);\n  }\n\n  if (!isFunction(mapFn)) {\n    return Promise.reject(new TypeError(\"RSVP.map expects a function as a second argument\"), label);\n  }\n\n  return Promise.all(promises, label).then(function (values) {\n    var length = values.length;\n    var results = new Array(length);\n\n    for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n      results[i] = mapFn(values[i]);\n    }\n\n    return Promise.all(results, label);\n  });\n}\n\n/**\n  This is a convenient alias for `RSVP.Promise.resolve`.\n\n  @method resolve\n  @static\n  @for RSVP\n  @param {*} value value that the returned promise will be resolved with\n  @param {String} label optional string for identifying the returned promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise that will become fulfilled with the given\n  `value`\n*/\nfunction resolve$2(value, label) {\n  return Promise.resolve(value, label);\n}\n\n/**\n  This is a convenient alias for `RSVP.Promise.reject`.\n\n  @method reject\n  @static\n  @for RSVP\n  @param {*} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n  @param {String} label optional string for identifying the returned promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n*/\nfunction reject$2(reason, label) {\n  return Promise.reject(reason, label);\n}\n\n/**\n `RSVP.filter` is similar to JavaScript's native `filter` method, except that it\n  waits for all promises to become fulfilled before running the `filterFn` on\n  each item in given to `promises`. `RSVP.filter` returns a promise that will\n  become fulfilled with the result of running `filterFn` on the values the\n  promises become fulfilled with.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n\n  let promise1 = RSVP.resolve(1);\n  let promise2 = RSVP.resolve(2);\n  let promise3 = RSVP.resolve(3);\n\n  let promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];\n\n  let filterFn = function(item){\n    return item > 1;\n  };\n\n  RSVP.filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(result){\n    // result is [ 2, 3 ]\n  });\n  ```\n\n  If any of the `promises` given to `RSVP.filter` are rejected, the first promise\n  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promise's\n  rejection handler. For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = RSVP.resolve(1);\n  let promise2 = RSVP.reject(new Error('2'));\n  let promise3 = RSVP.reject(new Error('3'));\n  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];\n\n  let filterFn = function(item){\n    return item > 1;\n  };\n\n  RSVP.filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(array){\n    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // reason.message === '2'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  `RSVP.filter` will also wait for any promises returned from `filterFn`.\n  For instance, you may want to fetch a list of users then return a subset\n  of those users based on some asynchronous operation:\n\n  ```javascript\n\n  let alice = { name: 'alice' };\n  let bob   = { name: 'bob' };\n  let users = [ alice, bob ];\n\n  let promises = users.map(function(user){\n    return RSVP.resolve(user);\n  });\n\n  let filterFn = function(user){\n    // Here, Alice has permissions to create a blog post, but Bob does not.\n    return getPrivilegesForUser(user).then(function(privs){\n      return privs.can_create_blog_post === true;\n    });\n  };\n  RSVP.filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(users){\n    // true, because the server told us only Alice can create a blog post.\n    users.length === 1;\n    // false, because Alice is the only user present in `users`\n    users[0] === bob;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method filter\n  @static\n  @for RSVP\n  @param {Array} promises\n  @param {Function} filterFn - function to be called on each resolved value to\n  filter the final results.\n  @param {String} label optional string describing the promise.
